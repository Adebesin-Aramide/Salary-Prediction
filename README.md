# Salary-Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project is about predicting workers salary based on number of hours worked.
I explored the dataset and was able to deduce that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable
I built a Machine learning model to help with the prediction(Linear Regression)
